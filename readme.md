### To View Results & Visualization : Project_Results_Visualization.pdf
### To Create Model : run CryptoProject_ModelCreation.py, which will create models, scalers, in corrosponding coin_data_directory under data_modelCreation
### To run withour streamlit : Just run CryptoProject_Prediction.py after runnig CryptoProject_ModelCreation.py
### To run with streamlit : Just run CryptoProject_Prediction_Streamlit.py after runnig CryptoProject_ModelCreation.py
### To Predict using LSTM models : data_modelCreation/corrosponding_coin/model.keras and .pkl files for inverse scaling
### To go though data, model, scaler: data_modelCreation
### Ignore : Other Files,  Not important files, creating few different usecases
